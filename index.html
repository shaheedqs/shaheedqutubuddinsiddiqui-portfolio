  <h2>INTRODUCTION:-</h2>
  <p>My name is <strong>Shaheed Qutubuddin Siddiqui</strong>, and I’m a passionate learner with a deep curiosity about the world around me — especially in the fields of technology, finance, and behavior. I recently appeared in my Intermediate (2nd Year) examinations under the <strong>Board of Intermediate Education Karachi (General Science Group)</strong>. Throughout my educational journey, I’ve always been encouraged by my family to seek knowledge and grow through both academic and personal development.</p>

  <p>My schooling years helped me develop a strong foundation. I studied from <strong>The Crescent Academy</strong> till Class 4, and then shifted to <strong>Montessori Complex Grammar School</strong>, where I completed my matriculation in the Pre-Medical group with <strong>first division</strong>. Later, I continued my studies at <strong>Govt. Dehli College</strong>, choosing General Science for intermediate. I secured a <strong>first division in 1st Year</strong>, and my 2nd Year result is currently awaited. This academic path has helped me grow not only in subjects but also in character — making me more disciplined, focused, and eager to learn new things.</p>

  <p>Over time, I’ve developed several practical skills. I am comfortable working with <strong>MS Word</strong>, creating formatted documents, notes, and papers. I also have a basic understanding of <strong>HTML</strong>, which I use to experiment with web layouts and page structures. I’ve given home tuitions to students from <strong>KG to Class 5</strong>, which has taught me how to explain complex ideas in a simple and patient way. I also enjoy doing <strong>research</strong>, especially on topics that involve modern technology, economics, and behavioral science.</p>

  <p>One of my biggest passions is <strong>Computer Science</strong>. I love exploring how computers work, how systems are built, and how technology is changing the world. I want to pursue this field further and grow as a professional who can solve real problems using logic and creativity. Alongside tech, I have a strong side interest in the <strong>financial world</strong> — including <strong>trading, economics, and decision-making psychology</strong>. I regularly read books that open my mind and help me understand how people think, how markets behave, and how countries grow.</p>

  <p>Some of the books that have had a great impact on me include <em>Misbehaving</em> by Richard H. Thaler, <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman, <em>Nudge</em>, <em>Noise</em>, and <em>The House of Rothschild</em> by Niall Ferguson. Books like <em>From Third World to First</em> by Lee Kuan Yew and <em>How Asia Works</em> by Joe Studwell have helped me think globally and practically. These readings have shaped how I see the world and how I plan my future.</p>

  <p>Right now, my <strong>short-term goal</strong> is to join an organization or environment where I can keep learning, contribute actively, and grow my real-world skills. In the long run, I want to become a well-rounded professional — someone who understands both technology and finance — and who can make a meaningful impact in the lives of others. Whether it’s through coding, teaching, or writing, I hope to keep growing and sharing what I learn.</p>

  <p><strong>Thank you for taking the time to read about me.</strong></p>

  <h2>EDUCATION:-</h2>
  <ul>
  <p>
    My educational journey began at <strong>The Crescent Academy – II</strong> in Gulshan-e-Iqbal Block 04, Karachi, where I studied from Montessori to Class 4 (2010–2016). During this early stage, I consistently maintained a <strong>First Division</strong> and developed strong foundational skills in reading, writing, mathematics, and classroom participation.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2017, after relocating to a new area, I joined <strong>Montessori Complex Grammar School</strong> in Gulshan-e-Iqbal Block 07, Karachi, and continued my studies there until Class 10 (June 2023). Throughout this period, I upheld a steady academic record and completed my <strong>Secondary School Certificate (SSC)</strong> in the Pre-Medical group under the <strong>Board of Secondary Education Karachi</strong>, achieving <strong>First Division</strong> in both Part I and Part II.
  </p>
  <p>
    For higher secondary education, I enrolled at <strong>Government Dehli College</strong> in Federal B Area, Karachi (September 2023 – June 2025), under the <strong>Board of Intermediate Education Karachi</strong>. I chose the <strong>General Science group</strong> and secured a <strong>First Division</strong> in 1st Year. Currently, my 2nd Year result is awaited, and the final percentage will be published according to the Board’s official evaluation.
